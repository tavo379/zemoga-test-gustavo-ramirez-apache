## Technologies

The project uses [datocms](https://www.datocms.com/) as backend to create the data.
The project use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for the app styles.
The project use [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) for fetch the data from datocms

All the bussiness logic was created with react-hooks.
Data persists in localStorage since I had trouble creating mutations and saving it to my backend

I am aware that much can be fixed, for example in the responsive part I could not finish or do it as I wanted since I am currently very busy in my work, I wanted to add theming capabilities but I cannot invest more time at the moment, I still wanted use the typography library.
On the other hand, I only managed to add the mobile responsive.

I appreciate the opportunity, I know that this can be improved a lot but due to my formal work, I have not been able to dedicate the time that it required.
